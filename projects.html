			I use technology on a regular basis both in my professional and private life,
			and as a result often am faced with a situation in which I do not like how a particular application is designed or discover
			that no adequate application exists to accomplish the task at hand.  When I am faced with such a circumstance, 
			I see this as an opportunity to create my own application!<br><br>
			I have included some of these applications below.  The source code for these applications resides within my 
			<link to github>Github profile</link> as well if you happen to be interested in that sort of thing.  
			Feel free to use these applications as you see fit and <link to bug report>report any bugs or suggestions</link> 
			to me so that I am able to fix or improve them as needed.
