						<p>I grew up in a small rural town in Ohio, moved to New Orleans for five years, and then moved back to a suburb in northern Cincinnati.
						Living in New Orleans has given me a unique perspective on life and offered experiences that I will never forget, but I have found that
						hurricanes are much less damaging when they reach Ohio than they are when they strike the Gulf Coast.</p>
						<p>I have always had a passion for computers, and have turned that passion into a <a href="Michael_Matthews_Resume.pdf">career in IT</a>.  I recently 
						decided to return to school and obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology.  I plan to use the knowledge that I have acquired (and am still learning)
						in order to pursue a role in application development.</p>
						<p>When I am not busy at work or studying, I enjoy <a href="#hobbies">cooking, cycling, and watching football (Go Saints!)</a>.  I also recently became
						the father to two beautiful twin girls who have, among other things, completely changed my view on life</p>

						<h1>Projects</h1>
						<p>I use technology on a regular basis both in my professional and private life.  I'm often faced with a situation in which I do not like how a 
						particular application is designed or discover that no adequate application exists to accomplish the task at hand.  When I am faced with such a circumstance, 
						I see this as an opportunity to create my own application!</p>
						<p>I have included some of these applications below.  The source code for these applications can be found within my 
						<a href="https://github.com/mm0426">Github profile</a> as well.  Feel free to use these applications as you see fit 
						and report any bugs or suggestions to me so that I am able to fix or improve them as needed.</p>

						<h1>Hobbies</h1>
						<p>I keep myself very busy throughout the day, but in my free time I enjoy cooking, cycling, and watching football.  
						I feel these activities pair well together as learning to cook my own food has resulted in a much healthier diet, 
						while cycling allows me to burn all of the calories from eating the delicious food that	I cook!</p>
						<p>I purchased my first home a couple of years ago, and as a result have dramatically increased my skills and knowledge of minor construction and repair.
						I'm also helping to raise my beautiful twin daughters, Grace and Evelyn.  I hope to do my part to make the world a better place to hand to them.</p>
