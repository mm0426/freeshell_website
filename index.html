				<a id="top">Welcome to my site!</a><br><br>
				I grew up in a small rural town in Ohio, moved to New Orleans for five years, and then moved back to a suburb in northern Cincinnati.
				Living in New Orleans has given me a unique perspective on life and offered experiences that I will never forget, but I have found that
				hurricanes are much less damaging when they reach Ohio than they are when they strike the Gulf Coast.<br><br>
				I have always had a passion for computers and have turned that passion into an <link to resume>8 year IT career</link>.  In 2011
				I made the decision to return to school to pursue a Bachelor Degree in Information Technology with a concentration in
				Software Development.  I currently maintain a 3.54 GTA and plan to graduate in 2015.
				I plan to use the knowledge that I have acquired and am currently learning in order to move from a support role into application development.<br><br>
				When I am not busy at work or studying, I enjoy <link to hobbies>cooking, cycling, and running</link>.  I am interested in learning to play the guitar, 
				but it would be a large understatement to say that I am bad at it.  
				I maintain a positive attitude about this by reminding myself that there is nowhere for my guitar playing skills to go but up!<br><br>

				I use technology on a regular basis both in my professional and private life,
				and as a result often am faced with a situation in which I do not like how a particular application is designed or discover
				that no adequate application exists to accomplish the task at hand.  When I am faced with such a circumstance, 
				I see this as an opportunity to create my own application!<br><br>
				I have included some of these applications below.  The source code for these applications resides within my 
				<link to github>Github profile</link> as well if you happen to be interested in that sort of thing.  
				Feel free to use these applications as you see fit and <link to bug report>report any bugs or suggestions</link> 
				to me so that I am able to fix or improve them as needed.<br><br>
				<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

				I keep myself very busy throughout the day but in my free time I enjoy cooking, cycling, and running.  
			I feel these activities pair well together as learning to cook my own food has resulted in a much healthier diet, 
			while cycling and running allows me to burn all of the calories that I receive from eating the delicious food that 
			I cook!<br><br>
			I have gathered a <link to recipe list>list of recipes</link> of dishes that I enjoy and invite you to <link to submit recipe>submit</link>
			your own recipes to this list.  I personally believe in eating as healthy as possible, but as you can see from my recipe list, I also like to indulge from time to time.
