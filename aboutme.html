				I grew up in a small rural town in Ohio, moved to New Orleans for five years, and then moved back to a suburb in northern Cincinnati.
				Living in New Orleans has given me a unique perspective on life and offered experiences that I will never forget, but I have found that
				hurricanes are much less damaging when they reach Ohio than they are when they strike the Gulf Coast.<br><br>
				I have always had a passion for computers and have turned that passion into an <link to resume>8 year IT career</link>.  In 2011
				I made the decision to return to school to pursue a Bachelor Degree in Information Technology with a concentration in
				Software Development.  I currently maintain a 3.54 GTA and plan to graduate in 2015.
				I plan to use the knowledge that I have acquired and am currently learning in order to move from a support role into application development.<br><br>
				When I am not busy at work or studying, I enjoy <link to hobbies>cooking, cycling, and running</link>.  I am interested in learning to play the guitar, 
				but it would be a large understatement to say that I am bad at it.  
				I maintain a positive attitude about this by reminding myself that there is nowhere for my guitar playing skills to go but up!
