			I keep myself very busy throughout the day but in my free time I enjoy cooking, cycling, and running.  
			I feel these activities pair well together as learning to cook my own food has resulted in a much healthier diet, 
			while cycling and running allows me to burn all of the calories that I receive from eating the delicious food that 
			I cook!<br><br>
			I have gathered a <link to recipe list>list of recipes</link> of dishes that I enjoy and invite you to <link to submit recipe>submit</link>
			your own recipes to this list.  I personally believe in eating as healthy as possible, but as you can see from my recipe list, I also like to indulge from time to time.
